A Fresh New Sleep Application

## Motivation
Many Americans face a common issue that is affecting their quality of life tremendously. This would be the lack of proper regulated sleep leading to sleep deprivation. Severe negative consequences can result from this such as memory issues, mood changes, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart disease, etc. Due to factors such as modern technology (blue light from smartphones at night), many people find themselves not only sleeping at much later times, but also a lower quality of sleep overall.
